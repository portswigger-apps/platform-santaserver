## 2025-08-06: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

SantaServer will be developed as an enterprise management platform that consolidates multiple moroz Santa servers into a unified hierarchical system, targeting medium to large enterprises (500+ macOS devices) with team-based rule management and approval workflows for Google's Santa macOS security agent.

### Context

Organizations currently deploy separate moroz Santa server instances per development team, leading to administrative overhead, inconsistent security policies, and lack of enterprise visibility. The market opportunity exists for a centralized solution that maintains team autonomy while providing enterprise-grade management, compliance reporting, and approval workflows.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Enhanced moroz deployment**
   - Pros: Familiar to existing Santa users, minimal learning curve
   - Cons: Doesn't solve fundamental scaling and management issues, limited enterprise features

2. **Custom Santa client modifications**
   - Pros: Deep integration with Santa ecosystem
   - Cons: Requires maintaining Santa client fork, complex deployment and updates

3. **Third-party MDM integration**
   - Pros: Leverages existing enterprise tools
   - Cons: Limited Santa-specific functionality, vendor lock-in

### Rationale

SantaServer addresses the core enterprise need for scalable Santa management while maintaining compatibility with Google's Santa protocol. The hierarchical team approach allows enterprise-wide policies with team autonomy, addressing the primary pain points identified in user research. The decision to use standard web technologies (FastAPI, Svelte, PostgreSQL) ensures maintainability and enterprise adoption.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Addresses clear market need in enterprise macOS security management
- Leverages proven technology stack for rapid development and deployment
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing Santa deployments
- Provides clear differentiation from existing solutions

**Negative:**
- Requires deep understanding of Santa sync protocol implementation
- Dependency on Google's Santa roadmap and protocol stability
- Complex enterprise sales cycle for customer acquisition
- Significant development effort for enterprise-grade features

## 2025-01-29: Technology Stack Selection

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Technology stack: Python 3.11 + FastAPI + SQLModel + PostgreSQL 17+ for backend; TypeScript + Svelte + Vite for frontend; Docker + Docker Compose for development; Microsoft Entra ID for authentication.

### Context

Need to select technology stack that supports rapid development, enterprise requirements (authentication, scaling, compliance), real-time features (WebSockets), and maintainability for small team.

### Rationale

FastAPI provides excellent performance, automatic OpenAPI documentation, and strong typing support required for enterprise APIs. SQLModel offers type-safe database operations essential for audit compliance. PostgreSQL 17+ provides enterprise-grade reliability and compliance features. **Svelte chosen for simpler ecosystem and better documentation** compared to React, while maintaining excellent performance. Microsoft Entra ID provides enterprise authentication without custom implementation.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Rapid development with strong typing throughout stack
- Enterprise-ready authentication and database capabilities
- Minimal frontend bundle size for better user experience
- Strong ecosystem support and documentation

**Negative:**
- Svelte has smaller talent pool compared to React ecosystem
- Microsoft Entra ID dependency limits non-Microsoft enterprises
- PostgreSQL 17+ requirement may limit deployment options

## 2025-08-06: Development Standards & Practices

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Development Team

### Decision

Adopt consistent coding standards: 2-space indentation for YAML, PEP8-compliant Python with 120-character line length, ESLint-friendly TypeScript, and Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology throughout the project.

### Context

Team needs established coding standards to maintain consistency, readability, and quality across the codebase. Current implementation already has tooling in place (black, flake8, eslint, pytest) that needs to be formalized.

### Rationale

TDD approach ensures reliable code and documentation through tests. 120-character line length balances readability with modern wide displays. 2-space YAML indentation is standard for configuration files. PEP8 compliance ensures Python code follows community standards. ESLint provides TypeScript quality assurance.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Consistent code style across entire team
- High code quality through TDD approach
- Automated enforcement through tooling
- Excellent test coverage and documentation

**Negative:**
- Requires discipline to maintain TDD approach
- Initial learning curve for any new team members
- Slightly longer development time for comprehensive testing

## 2025-08-06: Feature Prioritization - Focus on Core Santa Functionality

**ID:** DEC-004
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Development Team

### Decision

Prioritize core Santa server functionality with basic admin UI and RBAC authentication as immediate focus. Enterprise integrations and advanced features (community voting, AI suggestions) are deferred to later phases based on customer validation.

### Context

Team is at very beginning of development effort with basic scaffolding in place. Need to focus on essential functionality that delivers immediate value to organizations managing multiple moroz Santa servers.

### Rationale

Focus on solving the immediate pain point of managing multiple moroz servers before building advanced features. RBAC authentication and basic admin UI are essential for any enterprise deployment. Advanced features like integrations, voting systems, and AI can be validated with actual customers once core functionality proves valuable.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Faster time to market with core value proposition
- Reduced development risk and complexity
- Clear validation path for advanced features
- Lower resource requirements for initial deployment

**Negative:**
- May limit initial enterprise appeal without integrations
- Competitive disadvantage if competitors have advanced features
- Potential feature creep pressure from early customers
