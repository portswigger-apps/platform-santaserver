# SantaServer Mission (Lite)

SantaServer is an enterprise management platform that helps organizations consolidate multiple moroz Santa servers into a unified hierarchical system, providing team-based rule management for Google's Santa macOS security agent across large enterprises.

SantaServer serves medium to large enterprises managing macOS security policies across multiple development teams. Unlike traditional Santa deployments that require separate server instances and create administrative bottlenecks, SantaServer provides hierarchical team structures with intelligent approval workflows, enterprise system integration, and comprehensive audit capabilities that eliminate single points of failure while maintaining team autonomy.
